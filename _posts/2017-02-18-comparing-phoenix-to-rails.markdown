I recently wrote a blog post [comparing Phoenix to Rails](https://www.toptal.com/phoenix/phoenix-rails-like-framework-web-apps) on the Toptal Engineering Blog.  I explain what parts of Phoenix are different from Rails and how these differences can help you write better applications.  Hope you enjoy reading it!
