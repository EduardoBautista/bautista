~~**Update:** I am no longer using Ghost and have switched to Jekyll, but this is still useful for anyone that might run into the same problem.~~

~~**Update #2:** I switched back to Ghost.  They now offer a desktop app which I believe is awesome.~~

~~**Update #3 (2017-04-17):** I switched back to Jekyll.  A static site handles heavy loads with ease.~~

**Update #4 (2019-01-11):** I switched to [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) for the faster compile time.

I am using the [Ghost hosted platform](https://ghost.org/pricing/).  They support custom domains and I wanted to use my root domain (eduardobautista.com) instead of a subdomain (www.eduardobautista.com).  Ghost advises against doing this but I was not sure why; they are not that clear about the reason.

So despite their warning, I went ahead and did it anyway.  That's how I found out that when you add a CNAME record on the root domain, it will no longer use your dns records.  I found out about this when I was expecting an email and it never arrived (I use MX records on my domain because I use Google apps).

So that is why my blog is located at www.eduardobautista.com instead of just eduardobautista.com.
